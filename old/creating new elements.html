            <p> A vital contribution was made by Patricia Taylor, a professional writer and editor. She read through two
                    complete drafts of the book and made innumerable contributions to the style, organization, and content
                    of the manuscript. She deserves much of the credit for whatever lucid writing can be found in these
                    pages.</p>
                    <p> I am also grateful to Arthur Lipper Corporation for permission to use their mutual fund rankings,
                            Wiesenberger Investment Services for the use of their data in many of my tables, Moody's Investors
                            Service for permission to reproduce several of their stock charts, Consumers Union for their estimates
                            of life insurance costs, College Retirement Equities Fund for making available to me James Farrell's
                            performance studies, and Smith, Barney & Co., Inc. for allowing me the run of their investment library</p>
