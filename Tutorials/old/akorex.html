<h1> About Me </h1>

<p align = "center"/> <b> <ins> Akorex </ins> </b> </p>
<p> My name is Akorede. That is the name I use for my schooling and what every person I know calls me. <br/> <b> Akorex</b> is my nickname which I use for various personal purposes. It forms the basis for my social media accounts and it is the name I shall use for my programming persona. This essentially means that I am creating an alter-ego of myself. While <i> Akorede </i> will go to <ins> University of Lagos </ins> and study well for high grades like every other student like Ayomipo and others, <i> Akorex </i> will be like <del> "University of Lagos" </del>. For the next four years or till forever, Akorex will be the side of myself which will be the risk-taker, the creative one, the side which is not afraid to live up to anyone's expectations. Because Akorex builds those expectations for himself. And they're <b> goals </b> not <b> expectations</b>. </p>
<p align = "center"/> <h2> Why Akorex </h2> </p>
<p> Akorex has always been a part of myself. I have hidden that identity from myself for around 4-5 years while I study in Livingstone College. Although, I rediscovered myself in late SS2 when I began my blogging career thingy.<br/> The real Akorex was created when I read <b> Angels and Demons </b> by <b> Dan Brown </b> in 2016. I read a series of books which changed the way I thought that same year. While my identity as Akorex didn't fully emerge then, it was there in me. Through 2017, Akorex was hidden deep down Akorede. And that would have been repeated in 2018 had three events not happened - my phone, my not-so disappointing GPA, and finally reading another book - Rich Dad, Poor Dad. The dull situation of the economy isn't looking very bright And I finally see the reason I should create the two different personalities of myself. At least for the next four or five years, the part of me who'll wake up every day and dress up to school will be Akorede. This is actually to help Akorede knows that his duty is to go to school and love school like every other person does. He should have fun with it and get good grades because that's what is important for him. Then, Akorex will build himself in the world of technology, programming, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Akorex is currently handling the plan to have a worth of nothing less than a milion naira (in liquid cash and assets) by the end of my school life in the University.</p>

<ins> <h2> Programming Day 1 </h2> </ins>
<p> Akorede is finally on indefinite holiday till when the school resumes for the first semester of 200 level. This should give Akorex the time to learn very important stuffs. I have planned to read <b> How to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be </b>, <b> A brief History of Time </b>, <b> The Richest man in Babylon </b> and many others. Akorex will like to build on his financial knowledge as best as he can. Although procrastination is setting in and all, he's going to learn and master HTML and then proceed to designing sites with CSS and finally move to Javascript. </p>
<p> I heard we're going to deal with programming in C# when school resumes and that's probably going to have an effect on my programming career I would not like. By the way I learned to space with HTML today.I have added spaces between the last sentence and this one
